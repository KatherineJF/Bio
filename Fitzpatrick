At Developers Academy every day is focused on learning a new technical skill with aggressive timelines and rigorous standards. Flexibility, adaptable and agile. Pair programming and TDD.- 

The most personally rewarding part of my job as a Project Manager was finding technical solutions to business problems and building relationships. I hope to focus on building relationships but coupling that with the ability to create innovation solutions to business problems.
