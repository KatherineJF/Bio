The most personally rewarding part of my job as a Project Manager was implementing technical solutions to business problems by  building relationships between development teams and business partners. I hope to continue to focus on building relationships coupled with the ability to create innovation solutions to business problems. 

I have managed complicated data migration projects for large retail organizations. These positions required countless hours with business partners reviewing requirements and coordination with developers. Recently I managed a team of functional analysts supporting custom applications running supply-chain reports. I managed the software development life cycle process utilizing Agile methodologies to deliver applications that met our business partner’s requirements.

I applied to Ada to pursue a passion discovered volunteering for non-project community building organizations. In my role as a founding board member I utilized web-technologies to run social-media campaigns, developed a registration and payment process tool for classes and community events. 

I see programming as a means of closing the gap between my management experience and my technical ability. Personally, I have a passion for internet based communication and would like to programmatically change public opinion using artificial intelligence to spread information for worthwhile causes. The last few years have taught me that AI and Chatbots are already playing a role in public discourse, and I want the tools to help keep the new playing field level.
