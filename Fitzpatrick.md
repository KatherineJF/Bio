The most personally rewarding part of my job as a Project Manager was finding technical solutions to business problems and building relationships. I hope to focus on building relationships and coupling that with the ability to create innovation solutions to business problems. 

I applied to Ada to pursue a passion discovered volunteering for non-project community building organizations. In my role as a Technical Project Manager I utilized web-technologies to run social-media campaigns, developed a registration and payment process tool for classes and community events.
